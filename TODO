WARNINGS:
-Wshorten-64-to-32 as default

TESTS:
add a base class that is the base of ALL test which sets the correct values for temp paths, uba settings etc.

HIGH IMPORTANCE:
minilzo is licensed under GPL? If that really is the case, then we have to get rid of it (use xz?)

LONGTERM:
xz compression (complete abstract compression)

VERY LONGTERM:
Re-order treed-cqr set operations (diplomarbeit)

VERY LONGTERM:
HierarchicalCQR:
Based on Regions. Essential the GeoHierarchy::SubSet in a compressed form. Set-Operations can then be done on this subgraph.
In order to make this work, the graph has to be transformed to tree. We can simply do this by following the graph in in-order and skipping processed regions.
To create the real SubSet a bottom-up traversal is then needed. But the set-operations can all be done on the tree-subgraph.
Layout may be as follows (for a single region entry)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SUBTREESIZE|SUBTREE|CHILDRENCOUNT|CHILDRENOFFSETS|REGION_IS_FULLMATCH|REGION_EXCLUSIVE_PARTIAL_MATCHED_CELLS(ID,PTR)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
u32        |*      |u32          |[u32]          |boolean            |[(u32, u32)]
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

LONGTERM:
full support for relations

LONGTERM:
use builtin overflow (debian stable does not have gcc5)

HIGH IMPORTANCE: (done, unchecked, not needed anymore, make it optional)
neighbor-pointers in GeoHierarchy

HIGH IMPORTANCE:
fix TextSearchTraits bug (maybe this should be done two layers deeper)

HIGH IMPORTANCE: refactor geo architecture:
abstract GeoShape to have different backends
	-> manually add an extra level to specify continents (do this with a config)
	-> dynamic polygon simplification
	-> Split regions into their subregions

BUGS:
:^ (@highway eisenbahnstra√üe "aalen")
:west-of (alexanderplatz berling)

HIGH IMPORTANCE:
visualize cells in oscar-gui (currently segfault in MarbleMap)

HIGH:
add ability to use include statements in oscar-create config
