LONGTERM: (WIP)
Out of memory creation

LONGTERM:
xz compression (complete abstract compression)

LONGTERM:
Multiple set operation polcies for cells and items so it's possible to do:
a=rohrdommel
b=marabu
c=intersect(a,b, cells, unite items)

LONGTERM: 
Query Language improvements:
improve query refinement options: +-/^ neben dem key/value sodass man den key/value z.b. abziehen kann

LONGTERM:
Re-order treed-cqr set operations

LONGTERM:
HierarchicalCQR:
Based on Regions. Essential the GeoHierarchy::SubSet in a compressed form. Set-Operations can then be done on this subgraph.
In order to make this work, the graph has to be transformed to tree. We can simply do this by following the graph in in-order and skipping processed regions.
To create the real SubSet a bottom-up traversal is then needed. But the set-operations can all be done on the tree-subgraph.
Layout may be as follows (for a single region entry)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SUBTREESIZE|SUBTREE|CHILDRENCOUNT|CHILDRENOFFSETS|REGION_IS_FULLMATCH|REGION_EXCLUSIVE_PARTIAL_MATCHED_CELLS(ID,PTR)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
u32        |*      |u32          |[u32]          |boolean            |[(u32, u32)]
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

LONGTERM:
full support for relations

LONGTERM:
Split regions into their subregions

LONGTERM:
anderer zwischen-bla-blub query der die hierarchie nutzt.

LONGTERM:
use builtin overflow (debian stable does not have gcc5)

HIGH IMPORTANCE: (done, unchecked)
neighbor-pointers in GeoHierarchy

HIGH IMPORTANCE:
manually add an extra level to specify continents (do this with a config)

HIGH IMPORTANCE:
dynamic polygon simplification

HIGH IMPORTANCE:
fix TextSearchTraits bug (maybe this should be done two layers deeper)

HIGH IMPORTANCE:
abstract GeoShape to have different backends 

HIGH IMPORTANCE:
oscar-web: improve support for geoobjects: just add a reference in the query string and add ability to change polygon/paths/rectangles
So a query would look like that: $rect:1 + $poly:1 + $path:2 - $path:1
the ids would be replaced before sending to the server (needs some extra work to do the parsing of the uri)

NOW:
scoring is broken

NOW:
polygon query is broken? are cells split? such that they are connected?

NOW:
between query
